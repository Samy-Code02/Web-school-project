            <p>As the dust settles on a ceasefire and 11 days of Israeli aggression in the already besieged Gaza Strip, it's worth taking a moment to note the historical shift in narrative that has occurred, with many activists, celebrities, politicians and journalists, urging for continued use of social media to support the resistance.

                There is no denying that social media is playing an integral role in shifting perceptions when it comes to what is now commonly referred to as "apartheid", to describe the situation Palestinian people are facing.
                
                The ease and immediacy of sharing, retweeting and reposting has turned social media into a crucial tool in this successful shift in narrative.
                
                Over the past week, social media platforms have been brimming with hashtags such as #freepalestine and the opposing #standwithisrael. According to data from RiteTag, the latter had garnered 42 unique tweets per hour, 34.8 thousand hashtag exposures per hour, and 141 retweets per hour, while #freepalestine racked up 4,571 unique tweets per hour, 12.3 million hashtag exposures per hour, and 6,679 retweets per hour over the last 24 hours, which points to the substantial pace of these trends.</p>
